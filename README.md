# Web-Portfolio-Preview
With my website, I am creating a porfolio that features my dad's nature photography. His current website is a bit outdated, so I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try and make him a new one. The website will feature multiple pages, with an about page, gallery page, and a shows page. In my preview, I have a base layer for my website and how I want it to be structured, but I have not started styling it with CSS. This is my first time doing any type of coding and it is definitely not how my brain works, but I am giving it my best go.
