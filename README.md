# Web-Portfolio-Preview
With my website, I am creating a porfolio that features my dad's nature photography. His current website is a bit outdated, so I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try and make him a new one. This is my first time doing any type of coding and it is definitely not how my brain works, but I am giving it my best go.
