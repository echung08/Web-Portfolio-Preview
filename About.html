        <p>Dan has been taking photographs since the age of 10, first with a Kodak 110 instamatic camera, and then moving up to his first single lense relex, a Nikon Nikkormat FT3, as a teenager. His primary subject has always been wildlife. His growing interest in a career in the natural sciences further fueled his passion and interest for the natural world. Now having totally transitioned to digital photography, the flexibility and versatility this new medium brings, has greatly increased his creativity and vision for nature and outdoor photography</p>
